description,1,"Georeferenced Pseudotrack of the animal, giving an estimate of the animal's position at the same sampling rate of data. Start location of the data is the deployment location. Caution: the resulting pseudo-track is not reliable. Speed estimation from pitch and depth data is unproven and no allowance is made for currents. Use at your own risk!"
