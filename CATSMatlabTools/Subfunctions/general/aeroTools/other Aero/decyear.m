function dyear = decyear( varargin )
%  DECYEAR Calculate decimal year.
%   DY = DECYEAR( V ) converts one or more date vectors V into decimal year
%   DY.  Input V can be an M-by-6 or M-by-3 matrix containing M full or
%   partial date vectors respectively.  DECYEAR returns a column vector of
%   M decimal years.
%
%   A date vector contains six elements, specifying year, month, day, hour,
%   minute, and second. A partial date vector has three elements,
%   specifying year, month, and day.  Each element of V must be a positive
%   double precision number.
%
%   DY = DECYEAR( S, F ) converts one or more date character vectors S to
%   decimal year DY using format character vector F. S can be a character
%   array where each row corresponds to one date character vector, or one
%   dimensional cell array of character vectors.  DECYEAR returns a column
%   vector of M decimal years, where M is the number of character vectors
%   in S.
%
%   All of the date character vectors in S must have the same format F,
%   which must be composed of date format symbols according to Table 2 in
%   DATESTR help. Formats with 'Q' are not accepted by DECYEAR.  
%
%   Certain formats may not contain enough information to compute a date
%   number.  In those cases, hours, minutes, and seconds default to 0, days
%   default to 1, months default to January, and years default to the
%   current year. Date character vectors with two character years are
%   interpreted to be within the 100 years centered around the current
%   year.
%
%   DY = DECYEAR( Y, MO ,D ) and DY = DECYEAR( [Y, MO, D] ) return the
%   decimal year for corresponding elements of the Y, MO, D (year, month,
%   day) arrays. Y, MO, and D must be either one dimensional arrays of the
%   same length or scalar values.
%
%   DY = DECYEAR( Y, MO, D, H, MI, S ) and DY = DECYEAR( [Y, MO, D, H, MI, S] )
%   return the decimal years for corresponding elements of the Y, MO, D, H,
%   MI, S (year, month, day, hour, minute, second) arrays.  The six
%   arguments must be either one dimensional arrays of the same length or
%   scalar values. Limitation:
%
%   The calculation of decimal year does not take into account leap seconds.
%
%   Examples:
%
%   Calculate decimal year for May 24, 2005:
%      dy = decyear( '24-May-2005', 'dd-mm-yyyy' )
%
%   Calculate decimal year for December 19, 2005:
%      dy = decyear( 2006, 12, 19 )
%
%   Calculate decimal year for October 10, 2004 at 12:21:00 pm:
%      dy = decyear( 2004, 10, 10, 12, 21, 0 )
